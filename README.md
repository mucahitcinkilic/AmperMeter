# AmperMeter
 This repository contains the code and hardware design files for an STM32-based ammeter capable of measuring currents up to 2A. The project uses the INA219 sensor module to measure current and an OLED display to provide real-time feedback. A 10k potentiometer in series with a 330-ohm resistor is used as an adjustable load for testing and calibration purposes.
